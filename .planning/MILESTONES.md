# Project Milestones: Findo

## v1.0 MVP (Shipped: 2026-01-30)

**Delivered:** Autonomous SMB management platform that captures leads from missed calls, auto-replies to reviews, requests reviews after service, manages GBP content, and optimizes performance — all without owner intervention after a 2-minute setup.

**Phases completed:** 1-11 (67 plans total)

**Key accomplishments:**

- Multi-tenant foundation with queue-first architecture, encrypted token vault, and Row-Level Security for complete data isolation
- WhatsApp integration via Meta Embedded Signup enabling one-click connection and bidirectional messaging
- Lead capture system: missed calls → 2-minute delay → WhatsApp chatbot with AI intent extraction → owner notification
- Review management autopilot: hourly polling, AI auto-replies for positive reviews (Hebrew, personalized), owner approval workflow for negative reviews
- GBP content automation: weekly photo requests, monthly promotional posts, holiday hours reminders with Israeli calendar integration
- 2-minute setup wizard with PayPlus payment integration and progressive profiling

**Stats:**

- 5,822 TypeScript files created
- 29,580 lines of TypeScript
- 11 phases, 67 plans, 56 requirements
- 4 days from start to ship (2026-01-27 → 2026-01-30)

**Git range:** `feat(01-01)` → `test(10)`

**What's next:** Production deployment pending human UAT, then v1.1 improvements based on user feedback
