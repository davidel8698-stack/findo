### Blockers/Concerns

**From Research:**
- WhatsApp AI policy (Meta January 2026): AI must be supplementary, not primary functionality
- WhatsApp quality rating: Strict opt-in flows required to avoid death spiral
- Google OAuth tokens: Proactive refresh needed, ~1%/month unexplained revocations
- GBP API: No real-time webhooks for reviews (requires polling architecture)

**External Dependencies:**
- Meta Business Verification: 2-4 weeks for WhatsApp Business API approval
- Google API Access: 3-5 days for GBP API approval
- Voicenter: No official SDK, webhook reliability unknown
