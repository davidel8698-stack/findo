## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All v1 decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table with outcomes marked.

**v1.1 Architecture Decisions:**
- Next.js 16 (upgraded from planned 15.5) - sales website has no API routes
- Tailwind 4.0 with CSS-first @theme configuration
- Motion + GSAP two-library animation strategy
- Heebo font with preload optimization
- PostHog for analytics (session replay, funnels, A/B testing)
- Vercel for deployment (CDN, preview URLs)

**12-01 Decisions:**
- Used Next.js 16.1.6 instead of 15.5 - create-next-app defaults to latest, and sales website has no API routes so API stability concern doesn't apply
- Used app/ structure instead of src/app/ - create-next-app v16 default
- Tailwind 4.0 CSS-first with @theme blocks, no tailwind.config.ts

**12-02 Decisions:**
- Created Providers client component wrapper for DirectionProvider (server components cannot use React context)
- Established logical properties pattern (ps-/pe-/ms-/me- instead of pl-/pr-/ml-/mr-) for RTL support

**12-03 Decisions:**
- Upgraded @radix-ui/react-direction to 1.1.2-rc for React 19 compatibility (createContext fix)
- Centralized GSAP config in lib/gsapConfig.ts - all imports must go through this file
- Provider nesting order: DirectionProvider > MotionProvider > SmoothScroll (RTL outermost)

**12-04 Decisions:**
- Used website/* paths (not website/src/*) - aligns with 12-01 project structure
- cn() utility with clsx + tailwind-merge for class merging
- Israeli formatting utilities (formatPhone, formatPrice, formatDateHebrew)

**12-05 Decisions:**
- Frankfurt (fra1) Vercel region - closest edge to Israeli users
- Security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection) on all routes

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Production Readiness (v1.0):**
- RLS enforcement requires findo_app database user creation (documented in docs/rls-setup.md)
- Human UAT required before production deployment

**External Dependencies:**
- Meta Business Verification: Required for WhatsApp Business API
- Google API Access: OAuth consent screen approved
- PayPlus: Sandbox tested, production credentials needed

**v1.1 Dependencies:**
- Real customer testimonials needed (photos, names, metrics)
- Video testimonial production required
- Interactive demo platform decision (Storylane vs Navattic)
- Native Hebrew copywriter for final copy review

**Research Flags:**
- Phase 14: GSAP ScrollTrigger + Lenis integration with Next.js 16 App Router - RESOLVED in 12-03
- Phase 18: Interactive demo platform comparison and embed performance
