## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

| Decision | Phase | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|
| UUID primary keys for tenant_id | 01-01 | Prevents enumeration attacks |
| tenant_status enum (trial/active/grace/paused/cancelled) | 01-01 | Covers full lifecycle from CONTEXT.md |
| Default timezone Asia/Jerusalem | 01-01 | Israeli market focus |
| Soft delete with deleted_at | 01-01 | 90-day data retention requirement |
| Drizzle imports without .js extension | 01-01 | Compatibility with drizzle-kit CJS mode |
| AES-256-GCM for token encryption | 01-03 | Authenticated encryption prevents tampering |
| Per-value salt and IV | 01-03 | Same plaintext encrypts differently each time |
| scrypt key derivation | 01-03 | Adds brute-force protection beyond master secret |
| isValid status field for tokens | 01-03 | Health tracking without decryption |

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**From Research:**
- WhatsApp AI policy (Meta January 2026): AI must be supplementary, not primary functionality
- WhatsApp quality rating: Strict opt-in flows required to avoid death spiral
- Google OAuth tokens: Proactive refresh needed, ~1%/month unexplained revocations
- GBP API: No real-time webhooks for reviews (requires polling architecture)

**External Dependencies:**
- Meta Business Verification: 2-4 weeks for WhatsApp Business API approval
- Google API Access: 3-5 days for GBP API approval
- Voicenter: No official SDK, webhook reliability unknown

**User Setup Required:**
- ENCRYPTION_SECRET environment variable must be set before using token vault
