# Phase 14: Hero & First Impression - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-01
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Above-fold experience that passes the 5-second test with 100% accuracy. Visitor immediately knows what Findo is, what they can do, and who it's for. Includes hero section with visual, headline, subheadline, primary CTA, and trust signal.

## Implementation Decisions

### Hero Visual
- Activity feed montage showing automated actions Findo takes (review replied, photo posted, lead captured, call handled)
- Visual style: Floating cards appearing inside a phone mockup
- Demonstrates the core value: "Findo manages your Google Business 24/7 on autopilot, constantly optimizing to drive more referrals"
- Animation plays once on load, then holds on final state
- Animation personality: Playful and energetic (bouncy springs, dynamic entrances)

### Headline & Messaging
- Problem-focused angle — speak directly to the pain
- Target audience pain profile:
  - They know they need marketing but lack time, knowledge, money, and patience
  - Past failed attempts with agencies created distrust and frustration
  - Feelings: anxiety about business decline, uncertainty, sense of failure
  - They were sold dreams that never delivered results
- Researcher must consult Design Bible to determine:
  - Exact headline tone (empathetic validation vs direct challenge vs fresh start promise)
  - Subheadline approach (explain HOW vs reinforce emotional promise)

### Above-fold Layout
- Moderate density: headline + subheadline + CTA + trust signal + activity feed visual
- Primary CTA: Floating/sticky — visible at all times as user scrolls
- Multiple trust signals throughout site, but above-fold selection is Claude's discretion based on research

### Animation Behavior
- Auto-play on page load (no scroll trigger)
- Playful and energetic personality — matches Phase 13 bouncy spring physics
- Play sequence once, then pause on final state (no loop)
- Card count: Claude's discretion based on visual balance and timing

### Claude's Discretion
- Headline exact wording and tone (must research Design Bible)
- Subheadline approach (HOW vs emotional)
- Above-fold trust signal selection (customer count, result metric, star rating, or logo bar)
- Hero section height (full viewport vs peek below)
- Number of activity cards in sequence (3-4 vs 5-6)

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- Core value to communicate: "You do nothing. Findo manages your Google Business end-to-end on autopilot with constant optimization that drives more referrals."
- The visual must make the invisible visible — show the automation happening in real-time
- Activity cards should represent the breadth of what Findo does: reviews, posts, leads, calls
- Trust signals should be spread throughout site at strategic points, with the most impactful 1-2 above fold
- Headline must hit the target audience's exact pain — not generic marketing speak

**Emotional context for copy research:**
The target audience has tried marketing before. Agencies promised results and failed. DIY took too much time. They're skeptical, frustrated, and anxious about their business declining. The messaging must acknowledge this history without being patronizing — and offer a genuinely different solution (true automation, not another promise).
