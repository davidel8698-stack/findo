<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create TeamSection with founder story</name>
  <files>
    website/components/sections/trust/TeamSection.tsx
  </files>
  <action>
1. Create `website/components/sections/trust/` directory.

2. Create TeamSection.tsx with founder story focus (per CONTEXT.md):
   - Section heading: "הסיפור שלנו" (Our story) or "מי אנחנו" (Who we are)
   - Layout: image on one side, story on other (responsive)
   - Use RTL grid ordering like Hero (order-1/order-2 pattern)

3. Founder content block:
   - Placeholder photo: `/team/founder.jpg` (use Next.js Image, 200x200)
   - Name: placeholder "דוד ישראלי" (to be replaced with real name)
   - Role: "מייסד" (Founder)
   - Story text explaining pain point from personal experience:
     - Why Findo exists (personal frustration with local business marketing)
     - The realization that SMB owners are too busy to manage online presence
     - Mission: "להפוך כל עסק קטן לחכם כמו הגדולים"

4. Design details:
   - Rounded photo with subtle shadow
   - Quote-style story with large opening quotation mark
   - Signature-style name below story
   - ScrollReveal wrapper for entrance animation
   - Background: subtle gradient or pattern (bg-muted/30)

5. Make content easily replaceable (all text in constants at top of file).
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Component renders without errors
    - Image uses Next.js Image component
    - Text is in Hebrew and reads naturally RTL
    - Responsive layout works (stack on mobile, side-by-side on desktop)
  </verify>

  <name>Task 2: Create ContactSection with multiple contact methods</name>
  <files>
    website/components/sections/trust/ContactSection.tsx
    website/components/sections/trust/index.ts
  </files>
  <action>
1. Create ContactSection.tsx with contact information (TRUST-01):
   - Section heading: "דברו איתנו" (Talk to us) or "צרו קשר" (Contact us)
   - Subheading: "אנחנו כאן לכל שאלה" (We're here for any question)

2. Contact methods grid (3 cards):
   - WhatsApp (primary, highlighted):
     - Icon: MessageCircle or custom WhatsApp icon
     - Label: "וואטסאפ"
     - Value: placeholder number "050-123-4567"
     - Link: `https://wa.me/972501234567`

     - Label: "אימייל"
     - Value: placeholder "hello@findo.co.il"
     - Link: `mailto:hello@findo.co.il`

3. Card design for each contact method:
   - Hover effect (scale + shadow)
   - Icon with background circle
   - Stacked layout: icon, label, value
   - Full-width on mobile, 3-col grid on desktop

4. Optional: Add business hours note:
   - "שעות מענה: ראשון-חמישי 9:00-18:00"
   - Muted text below contact cards

5. Create index.ts barrel export:
   ```typescript
   export { TeamSection } from "./TeamSection";
   export { ContactSection } from "./ContactSection";
   ```

6. ScrollReveal wrapper with stagger for contact cards.
  </action>

  </verify>

After completing all tasks:
1. Run `cd website && pnpm build` - no errors
2. Test TeamSection layout on mobile and desktop
