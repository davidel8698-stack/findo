  <name>Task 1: Integrate social proof sections into homepage</name>
  <files>
    website/app/page.tsx
    website/components/index.ts
  </files>
  <action>
1. Update website/components/index.ts to export new sections:
   ```typescript
   // Social Proof Sections
   export {
     TestimonialsCarousel,
     TestimonialCard,
     VideoTestimonial,
     SocialProofCounters,
     FloatingActivityWidget,
     TrustBadges,
     GuaranteeBadge,
   } from "./sections/social-proof";

   // Trust Sections
   export {
     TeamSection,
     ContactSection,
   } from "./sections/trust";
   ```

2. Update website/app/page.tsx with section order (per psychological journey):
   ```tsx
   // After Hero:
   <SocialProofCounters />        // Metrics that matter (PROOF-06)
   <TestimonialsCarousel />       // Text testimonials (PROOF-01/02/03)
   <VideoTestimonial              // Video proof (PROOF-04)
     src="/videos/testimonial.mp4"
     poster="/videos/testimonial-poster.jpg"
   />
   <TrustBadges />                // Authority signals (PROOF-08)
   <TeamSection />                // Real people (TRUST-02)
   <ContactSection />             // Easy contact (TRUST-01)
   <FloatingActivityWidget />     // Ambient proof (PROOF-05)
   ```

3. Add section spacing between each component:
   - Use consistent `py-16 md:py-24` pattern
   - Alternate backgrounds where appropriate (bg-muted/30)

4. Add GuaranteeBadge inline variant near existing CTAs:
   - Below hero CTA group
   - Below testimonials section
   - Near any other CTA placement

5. Ensure StickyCtaBar from Phase 14 still works with new sections.

6. Wrap all new sections with proper container and section semantics.
