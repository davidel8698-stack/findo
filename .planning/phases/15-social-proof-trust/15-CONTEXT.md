# Phase 15: Social Proof & Trust - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-01
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Overwhelming evidence cascade that eliminates doubt — testimonials, metrics, case study, authority signals. Visitors see social proof so compelling that NOT signing up requires conscious resistance.

Requirements: PROOF-01 through PROOF-08, TRUST-01 through TRUST-08

## Implementation Decisions

### Testimonials Presentation
- Horizontal carousel layout — swipeable, one testimonial visible at a time with navigation
- Full attribution for each: real photo, full name, business name, specific metric ("saved 10 hours/week")
- Variety: mix of outcomes (more reviews, saved time, more leads) AND industries (restaurant, clinic, salon)
- Testimonial snippets appear near every CTA — not just in dedicated section

### Video Testimonial Behavior
- Autoplay muted when in viewport — starts playing automatically, no sound until clicked
- Burned-in Hebrew subtitles — always visible, no toggle needed
- Appears in both: featured video section (prominent) + smaller version in testimonials carousel
- Multiple short clips format — several 15-30 second clips from different customers

### Real-time Proof Design
- Both counter and activity feed — counter in hero, activity feed as floating widget
- Activity feed uses simulated animation — loops through pre-set activities with realistic timing
- Multiple counters showing: customers, reviews collected, leads captured — comprehensive proof
- Floating widget style — small notification-style pop-ups in corner of screen

### Trust Signals Architecture
- Contact: footer + dedicated section (not sticky header)
- Team: founder story focus — photo, story, why they built Findo
- Guarantee: badge near every CTA + dedicated section with full terms
- Security/authority: show all available — PayPlus, SSL, Google Partner, Meta Partner badges

### Claude's Discretion
- Carousel animation style and transition timing
- Exact floating widget positioning and appearance frequency
- Counter animation easing and duration
- Testimonial card design and spacing

## Specific Ideas

- Video testimonials should feel authentic, not produced — real customers in their businesses
- Activity feed should feel like watching real business happen (similar to hero animation)
- Founder story should explain the pain point from personal experience

None — discussion stayed within phase scope
