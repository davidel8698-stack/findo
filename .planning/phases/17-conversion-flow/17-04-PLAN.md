1. Ensure development server is running:
   ```bash
   cd website && npm run dev
   ```

2. Run production build to catch any SSR issues:
   ```bash
   cd website && npm run build
   ```

3. If build fails, diagnose and fix issues before proceeding to human verification.

4. Note the local URL (typically http://localhost:3000) for human testing.

Complete Phase 17 Conversion Flow:
- Lead capture form with name + phone fields (ACTION-04)
- Israeli phone auto-formatting (05X-XXX-XXXX) with validity checkmark (ACTION-05)
- Server action for form submission with Hebrew validation errors
- Confetti celebration animation on signup success (EMOTION-08)
- AnimatePresence form-to-success transition
- Strategic CTA placement (4-5 times on homepage) (ACTION-01)
- "What happens next" messaging below CTAs (ACTION-03)
- Social proof near CTAs (ACTION-08)
- Sticky mobile CTA that scrolls to form (MOBILE-03, ACTION-07)
- 48px touch targets on all buttons (MOBILE-08)
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Open http://localhost:3000 in browser. Test the following:

**Phone Input Validation (ACTION-05):**
1. In the hero form, start typing a phone number
2. Type "050" - should show "050" (no checkmark yet)
3. Type "0501234" - should show "050-123-4" (no checkmark, incomplete)
4. Type "0501234567" - should show "050-123-4567" with green checkmark
5. Try invalid prefix "040" - should NOT show checkmark even with 10 digits

**Form Submission:**
6. Enter name "Test" and valid phone "050-123-4567"
7. Click submit button
8. Observe loading state (shimmer animation on button)
9. On success, form should animate out and celebration should animate in
10. Confetti should burst (if reduced motion not enabled)
11. Success message should show in Hebrew

**CTA Distribution (ACTION-01):**
12. Scroll through the entire page
13. Count CTA sections - should be 4-5 (hero, after social proof, after pricing, after FAQ)
14. Each CTA section should have "what happens next" text nearby

**Mobile Testing (ACTION-07, MOBILE-03):**
15. Open mobile view (Chrome DevTools or actual phone)
16. Scroll past hero - sticky CTA bar should appear at bottom
17. Tap sticky CTA - should smooth scroll to hero form
18. Verify sticky bar doesn't cover footer content
19. Verify all form fields are easily tappable (48px+ height)

**RTL Verification:**
20. Verify phone input shows numbers correctly (not reversed)
21. Verify all Hebrew text reads right-to-left
22. Verify checkmark appears on the LEFT side of input (end-3 in RTL)

**Edge Cases:**
23. Submit with empty name - should show Hebrew validation error
24. Submit with invalid phone (9 digits) - should show Hebrew validation error
25. Try form on slower connection (DevTools throttle) - loading state should be visible

  <resume-signal>
Type "approved" if all tests pass, or describe issues found.

Issues format:
- [TEST #]: Description of failure
  </resume-signal>

<verification>
Human has tested all conversion flow functionality and approved or identified issues.

<success_criteria>
- Human approves all Phase 17 tests
- OR issues are documented for gap closure plan
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/17-conversion-flow/17-04-SUMMARY.md`

If approved, update `.planning/STATE.md` with Phase 17 completion.
If issues found, create 17-UAT.md for gap closure.
