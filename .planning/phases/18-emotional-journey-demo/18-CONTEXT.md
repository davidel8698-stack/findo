**Gathered:** 2026-02-02
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Create emotional resonance through pain/relief messaging, video demo, interactive demo, and delightful micro-interactions. This phase transforms the website from informative to emotionally compelling — visitors should FEEL the problem and the relief of the solution.

## Implementation Decisions

### Pain & Relief Messaging
- Pain point focus: **Lost money** — "You're losing customers right now" emphasizes missed revenue
- Relief tone: **Excitement** — "Watch your business grow" is forward-looking, growth-oriented
- Placement: **Both approaches** — Dedicated "problem → solution" section PLUS emotional touches woven into existing copy
- Specificity: **Mix of all styles throughout**:
  - Generic relatable (broad enough everyone sees themselves)
  - Vivid scenarios (storytelling with specific examples)
  - Data-driven statistics (numbers that shock)

### Video Demo Strategy
- Content: **Full customer journey** — Missed call → WhatsApp auto-reply → lead captured → review request → 5-star review
- Style: **Animated explainer** — Motion graphics, illustrated characters, polished storytelling
- Production: **Lottie animation** — Built in-house, not external production or placeholder
- Duration: Under 90 seconds per requirements

### Interactive Demo Platform
- Platform: **Claude's Discretion** — Research and select best option (Storylane, Navattic, or alternative)
- User freedom: **Guided with branches** — Main path with optional side explorations
- Placement: **Both options** — Embedded preview section + "Open full demo" button for modal
- Post-completion: **CTA + tracking** — "Ready to start?" CTA appears, dismissable, analytics track completion

### Micro-interactions & Polish
- Hover effects: **Playful** — Noticeable transforms, color shifts, personality
- Scroll animations: **Everything** — Every element has scroll-triggered animation, maximum polish
- Loading/transitions: **Staggered reveal** — Elements appear one by one in sequence, choreographed

### Claude's Discretion
- Video audio approach (Hebrew voiceover vs music + text)
- Interactive demo platform selection after research
- Micro-interaction style (Linear/Stripe/Apple influences — pick what fits Findo's playful-but-professional brand)
- Specific animation easing and timing curves
- Lottie animation detailed storyboard

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Pain examples should vary: some generic ("missed calls"), some vivid scenarios ("8pm call went to competitor"), some data-driven ("23% of leads lost")
- Video shows the complete automation loop in action — from trigger to happy customer
- Lottie animation allows in-house production without external video costs
- Interactive demo should feel explorable but guided — not overwhelming
- Every scroll should feel intentional and delightful — premium feel throughout
