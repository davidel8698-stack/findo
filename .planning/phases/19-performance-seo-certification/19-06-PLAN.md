  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Part A: 5-Second Test**
1. Show the homepage to someone unfamiliar with Findo for exactly 5 seconds
2. Ask: "What does this company do?"
3. Ask: "Who is it for?"
4. Ask: "What should you do next?"
Expected: 3/3 correct answers

If no one available, self-assess with fresh eyes after a break.

**Part B: Hebrew Copy Review**
1. Read all visible Hebrew text on the homepage
2. Check for:
   - Natural flow (not "translated Hebrew")
   - Consistent tone (conversational, "you" focused)
   - Correct grammar and spelling
   - Proper number formatting (phone, prices)
3. Note any awkward phrases or errors

**Part C: Device Testing (Chrome DevTools)**
1. Open site in Chrome DevTools
2. Test these viewports:
   - iPhone SE (375x667)
   - iPhone 12 Pro (390x844)
   - Samsung Galaxy S20 (360x800)
   - iPad (768x1024)
3. For each viewport:
   - Scroll entire page - no horizontal overflow
   - Tap all CTAs - responsive touch targets
   - Check text readability - no text too small
   - Verify images load - no broken images

**Part D: Design Bible Certification Score**
Run through the certification checklist from Task 1.
Score each category and calculate total.

Confirm:
- [ ] Lighthouse Performance 95+ (from Plan 05)
