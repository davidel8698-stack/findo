  <name>Task 1: Visual quality verification</name>
  <what-built>
Complete 3D phone mockup with:
- Pre-rendered 3D phone image (user-provided)
- Multi-layer CSS shadows for realistic depth
- Screen glow with brand orange tint
- Continuous activity feed loop (8-12 second cycle)
- Scroll parallax (20-40px movement)
- Mouse parallax on desktop (3 degree tilt)
- RTL-correct positioning (phone on left of text)
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Desktop Verification (http://localhost:3000):**

1. **Visual Quality:**
   - Phone mockup displays with photo-realistic 3D quality
   - Multi-layer shadow creates floating depth effect
   - Screen glow visible as subtle orange ambient light
   - Rim light visible on phone edge (dark mode)
   - Overall feel matches premium SaaS sites (Linear, Stripe)

2. **Activity Feed Animation:**
   - Cards animate in with stagger
   - Hold visible for ~4 seconds
   - Animate out upward
   - Loop restarts after brief pause
   - Full cycle is 8-12 seconds
   - Animation feels smooth and professional

3. **Parallax Effects:**
   - Move mouse around: Phone tilts subtly toward cursor
   - Scroll page: Phone moves slower than content
   - Both effects feel smooth and natural
   - No jank or stuttering

4. **RTL Layout:**
   - Phone appears on LEFT side of screen
   - Text content appears on RIGHT side
   - Visual balance looks correct

**Mobile Verification (Chrome DevTools or device):**

5. **Responsive:**
   - Phone displays at smaller size (240px width)
   - Activity feed still visible and readable
   - Scroll parallax works (no mouse parallax)
   - No horizontal overflow

6. **Performance:**
   - Scroll is smooth (60fps)
   - No visible lag during animations
   - No layout shift when entering view

**Lighthouse Check:**
7. Run Lighthouse Performance audit
   - LCP should be < 2.5s (phone image priority loaded)
   - CLS should be 0 (no layout shift)
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
Type "approved" if visual quality meets expectations.
Or describe specific issues that need adjustment.

User confirms:
1. Phone mockup visual quality is premium
2. Activity feed animation loops correctly
3. Parallax effects work on desktop
4. Mobile experience is smooth
5. RTL layout is correct
6. Performance metrics acceptable
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- User approves visual quality as premium/world-class
- Activity feed loop timing feels right (8-12s)
- Parallax creates intended depth effect
- No performance regressions
- All Phase 23 requirements (MOCK-01 through MOCK-07, RTL-04) satisfied
</success_criteria>
