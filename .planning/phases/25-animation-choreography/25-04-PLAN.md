<objective>
Apply SectionReveal to remaining sections and conduct visual verification of the complete animation choreography system.

Purpose: Ensure all sections have consistent scroll-triggered reveals and the full animation system meets CONTEXT.md quality bar: "confident and decisive" entrance, "unified" stagger groups.

Output:
- All major page sections wrapped with SectionReveal
- Visual verification checkpoint confirming animation quality

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Apply SectionReveal to remaining page sections</name>
  <files>website/app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Audit page.tsx and wrap major sections with SectionReveal for consistent scroll-triggered reveals.

**Sections to wrap (if not already animated):**
1. ROI Calculator section
2. FAQ section
3. Pricing section (if exists)
4. Founder section (if exists)
5. Contact/Signup section
6. Footer (optional - subtle fade)

For each section, apply the pattern:
```tsx
import { SectionReveal, SectionRevealItem } from "@/components/motion";

// Wrap section content
<section id="roi" className="...">
  <div className="container mx-auto">
    <SectionReveal>
      <SectionRevealItem>
        {/* Section heading */}
      </SectionRevealItem>
      <SectionRevealItem>
        {/* Section content */}
      </SectionRevealItem>
    </SectionReveal>
  </div>
</section>
```

**Guidelines:**
- Hero section: Already handled by useHeroEntrance (Plan 01) - do NOT wrap with SectionReveal
- Stats section: Already handled (Plan 03) - verify it's working
- Testimonials: Already handled (Plan 03) - verify it's working
- Other sections: Wrap with SectionReveal + SectionRevealItem

Use standard fade personality (default) for most sections.

  <done>Remaining page sections wrapped with SectionReveal for consistent animation</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Ensure LeadCaptureForm respects reduced motion for shake</name>
  <files>website/components/sections/conversion/LeadCaptureForm.tsx</files>
  <action>
The LeadCaptureForm from Phase 24 has shake animation for errors. Ensure it respects reduced-motion preference.

Check if useShake hook already respects reduced motion. If not, update:

```tsx
// In useShake.ts or LeadCaptureForm.tsx
import { useReducedMotion } from "motion/react";

// In the component or hook
const prefersReducedMotion = useReducedMotion();

// Disable shake for reduced motion users
if (prefersReducedMotion) {
  // Just show error state without shake
  return;
}
```

Note: Use Motion's built-in `useReducedMotion` from `motion/react` - it's well-tested and reduces custom code. This is consistent with Plan 25-02 and 25-03 which also use the Motion built-in.

The form should:
- Show error styling (red border, error message) regardless of motion preference
- Only shake if user hasn't requested reduced motion
- Error glow pulse should also respect reduced motion (static red glow instead)
  </action>
  <verify>LeadCaptureForm error shake disabled when prefers-reduced-motion is set</verify>
  <done>LeadCaptureForm shake animation respects reduced motion preference</done>

  <what-built>
Complete animation choreography system for Phase 25:
1. Hero entrance with 7-phase GSAP timeline (~1.2s, overlapping phases)
2. Scroll-triggered section reveals with fast cascade stagger (50-75ms)
3. Stats counter simultaneous count-up animation
4. Testimonials alternating slide-in from sides
5. Reduced motion fallback (opacity-only) for all animations
6. RTL-aware slide directions
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Step 1: Hero Entrance**
1. Open http://localhost:3000 in browser
2. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R) to see entrance from scratch
3. Verify 7-phase sequence:
   - Background fades in first
   - Headline appears with upward rise
   - Subheadline follows
   - CTA buttons scale in with bounce
   - Phone mockup rises (larger motion than text)
   - Activity feed starts after ~1s
4. Total entrance should feel "snappy and confident" (~1-1.2s)

**Step 2: Scroll Reveals**
1. Scroll slowly down the page
2. Verify each section reveals with fade + subtle rise
3. Verify children animate in sequence (fast cascade, not simultaneously)
4. Scroll back up - animations should NOT replay (once only)

**Step 3: Stats Section**
1. Scroll to stats section
2. Verify counters:
   - Fade in with stagger
   - Numbers count up simultaneously (unified impact)
   - Count goes from 0 to final number
   - Animation takes ~2-2.5s to complete

**Step 4: Testimonials**
1. Scroll to testimonials section
2. Verify cards slide in from alternating sides
3. In RTL: first card from right, second from left, etc.

**Step 5: Reduced Motion**
1. Enable "Reduce motion" in OS accessibility settings
   - Windows: Settings → Accessibility → Visual effects → Animation effects OFF
   - Mac: System Preferences → Accessibility → Display → Reduce motion
2. Hard refresh the page
3. Verify:
   - Hero elements fade in without movement
   - Scroll reveals fade without rise
   - Stats numbers appear at final value (no counting)
   - Testimonials fade without slide
   - No shake animation on form errors

**Step 6: Performance**
1. Open DevTools → Performance tab
2. Record while scrolling through page
3. Verify frame rate stays ~60fps
4. Check for layout shift (should be 0)

<success_criteria>
User approval of complete animation choreography system:
- Hero entrance feels "snappy and confident"
- Scroll reveals create "unified groups" with fast cascade
- Stats have "unified impact" with simultaneous count
- Testimonials slide from alternating sides
- Reduced motion fully respected
- 60fps maintained throughout
</success_criteria>
