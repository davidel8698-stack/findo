<objective>
Apply glassmorphism to ContactSection form card and LeadCaptureForm with proper visual treatment.

Purpose: Add glass effects to form-containing cards per CONTEXT.md decision "Contact form: Glass treatment on form card", ensuring form inputs remain readable and accessible.
Output: Updated ContactSection and LeadCaptureForm with glass treatment.

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Apply glass treatment to ContactSection form card</name>
  <files>website/components/sections/trust/ContactSection.tsx</files>
  <action>
Read the ContactSection.tsx file to find the card/wrapper containing the contact form.

Look for the main card container (typically using Card component or div with bg-card). Apply glass-strong treatment to the form card container.

If the component uses Card component with rimLight:
- Add glass-strong class
- Set rimLight={false} (per CONTEXT.md: don't layer glass + rimLight)

If it uses a div with bg-card or similar:
- Replace bg-card with glass-strong class
- Remove any existing border classes that glass-strong will override

Example transformation:
```tsx
// Before
<Card className="..." rimLight>
  {/* form content */}
</Card>

// After
<Card
  className={cn("...", "glass-strong")}
  rimLight={false}
>
  {/* form content */}
</Card>
```

Or for div containers:
```tsx
// Before
<div className="bg-card border rounded-xl p-6">
  {/* form content */}
</div>

// After
<div className="glass-strong rounded-xl p-6">
  {/* form content */}
</div>
```

Ensure cn import is present if using it.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Apply glass treatment to LeadCaptureForm</name>
  <files>website/components/sections/conversion/LeadCaptureForm.tsx</files>
  <action>
Read LeadCaptureForm.tsx to find the form card container.

Apply glass-strong treatment to the form wrapper. This is the main lead capture form used in ConversionSection.

Look for the primary card/wrapper element (likely Card or AnimatedCard component, or a styled div).

Apply transformation similar to Task 1:
- Add glass-strong class to the card container
- Remove rimLight if using Card component (set rimLight={false})
- Remove any bg-card or similar background classes that glass-strong replaces

Important: Ensure form inputs remain accessible. The Input component already has its own styling (from Phase 24) with focus states. Glass background on the card should not affect input readability because:
1. Input component has its own background
2. Glass creates contrast with background orbs
3. Text remains foreground-colored

If the form doesn't have an explicit card wrapper (form elements directly in parent), wrap the form content in a glass-strong container:
```tsx
<div className="glass-strong rounded-xl p-6">
  <form ...>
    {/* form content */}
  </form>
</div>
```
  </action>
  <verify>Grep for "glass" in LeadCaptureForm.tsx returns a match</verify>
  <done>LeadCaptureForm uses glass treatment</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Verify ConversionSection glass integration</name>
  <files>website/components/sections/conversion/ConversionSection.tsx</files>
  <action>
Read ConversionSection.tsx to verify the LeadCaptureForm integration.

ConversionSection wraps LeadCaptureForm and may have its own card styling. Check if:
1. ConversionSection has a card wrapper that needs glass treatment
2. Or if LeadCaptureForm handles its own glass styling (from Task 2)

If ConversionSection has a separate card wrapper around LeadCaptureForm:
- Apply glass-strong to that wrapper as well
- Ensure we don't have nested glass cards (performance and visual issue)

If ConversionSection just passes through to LeadCaptureForm:
- No changes needed here
- Document that glass is applied at LeadCaptureForm level

Avoid double-glass: Only one layer of glass per card. If ConversionSection wraps LeadCaptureForm in a card AND LeadCaptureForm has its own card, choose which one gets glass and ensure the other is transparent or removed.

  <verify>Run `npm run build` - completes without errors</verify>
  <done>ConversionSection/LeadCaptureForm glass integration verified - no nested glass</done>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. `npm run build` completes successfully
2. ContactSection has glass treatment on form card
3. LeadCaptureForm has glass treatment
4. No nested/doubled glass cards
5. Form inputs remain readable and functional
6. rimLight disabled on glass cards

<success_criteria>
- Contact section form card uses glass-strong
- Lead capture form uses glass-strong
- No visual issues with doubled glass
- Form inputs accessible and readable
- Glass doesn't affect form functionality
