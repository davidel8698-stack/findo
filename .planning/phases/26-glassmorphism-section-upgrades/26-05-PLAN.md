<objective>
Verify RTL carousel arrows, validate all section upgrades, and run performance verification to ensure Lighthouse 95+ gate is met.

Purpose: Final validation that all Phase 26 requirements are met, including RTL carousel behavior and critical performance gate.
Output: Verified carousel RTL behavior, section upgrades checklist, and Lighthouse performance confirmation.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Verify and fix RTL carousel arrow positioning</name>
  <files>website/components/ui/carousel.tsx</files>
  <action>
Verify that carousel arrows use RTL-aware positioning (start/end) instead of left/right.

Read carousel.tsx and check CarouselPrevious and CarouselNext components.

Current code (per prior read) uses:
- CarouselPrevious: `-start-14 top-1/2` (RTL-aware)
- CarouselNext: `-end-14 top-1/2` (RTL-aware)

This is already correct for RTL! The `-start-14` positions the "previous" button on the right side in RTL (which is the start direction), and `-end-14` positions "next" on the left (which is the end direction in RTL).

Also verify:
- ArrowRight icon in CarouselPrevious (points right, which is "forward" in RTL)
- ArrowLeft icon in CarouselNext (points left, which is "forward" in RTL)

If the icons need swapping for RTL clarity, check if the icons should be swapped. In RTL:
- "Previous" goes right (ArrowRight is correct)
- "Next" goes left (ArrowLeft is correct)

The current implementation appears correct. Document verification in summary.

If any issues found, fix:
- Ensure `-start-*` and `-end-*` classes are used (not `-left-*` or `-right-*`)
- Ensure icon direction matches visual expectation

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify all 10 section upgrades with Phase 20-25 visual language</name>
  <files>website/app/page.tsx</files>
  <action>
Run through each of the 10 sections specified in ROADMAP.md and verify they have Phase 20-25 visual upgrades.

Create a verification checklist:

**SECT-01 Hero** - Check Hero.tsx:
- [ ] Gradient text on headline (Phase 20)
- [ ] Background orbs visible (Phase 21)
- [ ] CTA glow effects (Phase 22)
- [ ] Phone mockup with shadows (Phase 23)
- [ ] Hover/interaction states (Phase 24)
- [ ] Entrance animations (Phase 25)

**SECT-02 Stats** - Check SocialProofCounters.tsx:
- [ ] Glass-light treatment (Phase 26)
- [ ] Count animations (Phase 25)

**SECT-03 Testimonials** - Check TestimonialsCarousel.tsx:
- [ ] Glass-light on cards (Phase 26)
- [ ] Slide animations (Phase 25)

**SECT-04 ROI Calculator** - Check ROICalculator.tsx:
- [ ] Polish only (no glass per CONTEXT.md)
- [ ] Interactions working

**SECT-05 FAQ** - Check FAQSection.tsx:
- [ ] Accordion animations
- [ ] Hover states

**SECT-06 Pricing** - Check PricingSection.tsx:
- [ ] Card hover effects

**SECT-07 Founder/Team** - Check TeamSection.tsx:
- [ ] Photo effects
- [ ] Gradient accents

**SECT-08 Contact** - Check ContactSection.tsx:
- [ ] Glass treatment on form card (Phase 26)
- [ ] WhatsApp emphasis

**SECT-09 Footer** - Check page.tsx footer section:
- [ ] No glass (per CONTEXT.md)
- [ ] Consistent styling

**SECT-10 Navigation** - Check layout/GlassNav:
- [ ] Glass when scrolled (Phase 26)

Read page.tsx to trace all section imports and verify presence. Don't make changes - document findings in summary.
  </action>
  <verify>Build passes (`npm run build`) and page.tsx imports all 10 section areas</verify>
  <done>All 10 sections verified with visual language upgrades</done>

  <what-built>
Glassmorphism effects applied to:
- SuccessCard (feature cards) with glass-strong
- SocialProofCounters (stat cards) with glass-light
- TestimonialCard with glass-light
- ContactSection form card with glass-strong
- LeadCaptureForm with glass-strong
- GlassNav for scrolled navigation
- StickyCtaBar with solid mobile fallback

RTL carousel arrows verified as correct.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Run dev server: `cd website && npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:3000 in Chrome

**Glass Effect Verification:**
3. Scroll to Relief section - SuccessCards should show glass effect (desktop) or solid dark (mobile)
4. Scroll to Stats section - counter cards should have subtle glass
5. Scroll to Testimonials - testimonial cards should have subtle glass
6. Scroll to Contact section - form card should have glass effect
7. Test mobile view (DevTools) - glass should fall back to solid dark background

**RTL Carousel Verification:**
8. Scroll to Testimonials carousel
9. Verify arrow positions: Previous button on RIGHT, Next button on LEFT (RTL)
10. Click arrows - should navigate correctly

**Performance Verification (CRITICAL GATE):**
11. Build production: `npm run build`
12. Run Lighthouse audit in Chrome DevTools (Performance tab)
13. Performance score MUST be 95+ (critical gate per ROADMAP)

**Glass Element Count:**
14. At any scroll position, count visible glass elements
15. Should not exceed 6-8 per viewport (performance budget)

Report any issues found.
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if Lighthouse 95+ and visual checks pass, or describe issues</resume-signal>
</task>

<verification>
1. `npm run build` completes successfully
2. Carousel arrows use -start-/-end- positioning (RTL-aware)
3. All 10 sections have Phase 20-25 visual language
4. Glass elements per viewport <= 6-8
5. Lighthouse Performance >= 95 (critical gate)
6. Glass effects visible on desktop, solid fallback on mobile
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- RTL-03: Carousel arrows swap sides correctly for RTL
- SECT-01 through SECT-10: All sections upgraded with visual language
- GLASS-05: Maximum 6-8 glass elements per viewport (verified)
- Critical gate: Lighthouse Performance 95+
- Mobile fallback working (solid background, no backdrop-blur)
</success_criteria>
