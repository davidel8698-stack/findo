## Typography Fundamentals

- [ ] **HEB-01**: All Hebrew text displays correctly (no broken/missing characters)
- [ ] **HEB-02**: Line height provides comfortable reading (~1.8 for body text)
- [ ] **HEB-03**: Text alignment is right-aligned (RTL) where appropriate
- [ ] **HEB-04**: No orphaned single words at end of paragraphs where avoidable
- [ ] **HEB-05**: Font weights render correctly (bold Hebrew can be problematic)

---

## Visual Hierarchy

- [ ] **HEB-06**: Headlines are clearly distinguished from body text
- [ ] **HEB-07**: Bold text is readable (not too thick/thin)
- [ ] **HEB-08**: Muted text (lighter color) is still legible
- [ ] **HEB-09**: Gradient text renders correctly with Hebrew characters
- [ ] **HEB-10**: Text size hierarchy creates clear visual flow

---

## Content Quality

- [ ] **HEB-11**: Grammar is correct (no obvious errors)
- [ ] **HEB-12**: Phrasing sounds natural to native speakers
- [ ] **HEB-13**: Professional tone appropriate for B2B SaaS
- [ ] **HEB-14**: No awkward transliterations or unnecessary anglicisms
- [ ] **HEB-15**: Terminology is consistent throughout the page

---

## Layout & RTL

- [ ] **HEB-16**: Icons and arrows point correct direction for RTL
- [ ] **HEB-17**: Numeric content (prices, percentages) displays correctly
- [ ] **HEB-18**: Mixed Hebrew/English text (if any) flows naturally
