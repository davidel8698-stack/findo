  <name>Task 1: 60fps Animation Verification</name>
  <what-built>Animation system with hero entrance, scroll reveals, hover effects - all designed for 60fps on mid-range devices</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Execute the 60fps testing procedure from 27-02-SUMMARY.md:

1. Ensure production server is running (npm run build && npm start)
2. Open http://localhost:3000 in Chrome
3. Open DevTools (F12) > Performance tab
4. Click gear icon, set CPU to "4x slowdown"
5. Enable Screenshots
6. Click Record
7. Wait for hero animation to complete
8. Scroll slowly through ENTIRE page
9. Hover over buttons and cards
10. Click Stop
11. Check FPS chart:
    - Green = 60fps (good)
    - Red bars = jank (bad)
    - Note any sections with drops

**Report these results:**
- Overall FPS: Maintained 60fps? (yes/no)
- Jank sections: List any sections with frame drops
- Glass elements: Any jank on Stats/Testimonials/Contact cards?
- Hero entrance: Smooth or stuttering?

**Targets:**
- PERF-05: 60fps animations (no visible jank)
- PERF-06: Tested with CPU throttling (simulating Galaxy A24)
- CERT-03: Mid-range device simulation complete
- CERT-05: No glassmorphism jank

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 2: Collect Professional Ratings</name>
  <action>
User must create Google Form and collect ratings from 5 target customers.

**Steps:**
1. Create Google Form using template from professional-rating-form.md
2. Add production URL to form description
3. Send to 5 small business owners (target customers)
4. Collect all 5 responses
5. Calculate average: (Q1+Q2+Q3+Q4)/4 per rater, then average of 5

**Target:** CERT-01 requires 9+ average

**Per CONTEXT.md:** "5 raters are target customers: actual small business owners who match the target audience"
  </action>
  <instructions>
This step requires user to:
1. Create the Google Form
2. Recruit 5 small business owners
3. Collect responses (may take days)
4. Calculate and report average
  </instructions>
  <resume-signal>Report: "Rating average: [X.X] - PASS/FAIL"</resume-signal>

<task type="checkpoint:human-action" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 3: Execute Hebrew Typography Review</name>
  <action>
User (native Hebrew speaker) must complete the Hebrew review checklist.

**Steps:**
1. Open hebrew-review-checklist.md
2. Visit production website
3. Check each of the 20 items
4. Mark PASS or FAIL for each
5. Document any issues found

**Target:** CERT-04 requires all items PASS or issues documented and resolved

**Per CONTEXT.md:** "User (native Hebrew speaker) performs the review personally" and "Any issues found block certification until fixed"
  </action>
  <instructions>
This step requires user to personally review as native Hebrew speaker.
Cannot be delegated to non-native speakers.
  </instructions>
  <resume-signal>Report: "Hebrew review: [N]/20 PASS" with any issues listed</resume-signal>
