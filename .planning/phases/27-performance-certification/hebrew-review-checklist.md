## Review Notes

### Areas to Inspect

1. **Hero section** - Main headline, subheadline, CTA button text
2. **Features section** - All feature cards and descriptions
3. **Stats section** - Numbers and their labels
4. **Testimonials** - Customer quotes (check natural phrasing)
5. **Conversion section** - Final CTA messaging
6. **Footer** - Links, copyright, legal text
7. **Lead capture form** - Labels, placeholder text, button
8. **Navigation** - All menu items

### What Constitutes "FAIL"

- **Critical:** Any broken characters, unreadable text, or wrong alignment
