## Certification Calculation

### CERT-01 Requirement
**Target:** Average rating of 9+ out of 10 across all raters

**Calculation method:**
1. For each rater, calculate their average: `(Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4) / 4`
2. Average all 5 raters' averages together
3. Result must be >= 9.0

**Example:**
| Rater | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Avg |
|-------|----|----|----|----|-----|
| 1     | 10 | 9  | 9  | 10 | 9.5 |
| 2     | 9  | 9  | 10 | 9  | 9.25|
| 3     | 9  | 10 | 9  | 9  | 9.25|
| 4     | 8  | 9  | 9  | 9  | 8.75|
| 5     | 10 | 10 | 9  | 10 | 9.75|
| **Overall** | | | | | **9.30** |

Result: 9.30 >= 9.0 = **PASS**

### Minimum Required
- **5 complete responses** from target customers
- **Overall average: 9.0** or higher
- Any score below 9.0 requires iteration on website and re-testing

## After Collecting Responses

1. Export responses to Google Sheets
2. Calculate averages per the method above
3. Document results in certification tracker
4. If below 9.0, identify lowest-scoring dimensions for improvement
