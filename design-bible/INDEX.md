## Golden Questions

### The Most Powerful Question (ask to CUSTOMERS):
> "What nearly stopped you buying from us?"

### Other Critical Questions:
- "How likely are you to recommend us?" (NPS)
- "How would you describe us to a friend?"
- "Why did you decide to use us?"
- "What would persuade you to use us more often?"

---

## Core Principles

### On Writing
> "If visitors can't understand your writing, they can't buy."

### On Design
> "Design for a moron in a hurry."

### On Testing
> "A winning A/B test is your visitors voting with their feet."

### On Assumptions
> "Never trust your intuition. Diagnose first."
