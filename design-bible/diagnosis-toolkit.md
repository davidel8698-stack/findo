> "Testing one user is 100% better than testing none." — Don't Make Me Think

**How to conduct (Krug's Method):**
1. **Welcome** (4 min) - Make them comfortable
2. **Background questions** (2 min) - Basic info
3. **Home page tour** (3 min) - First impressions
4. **Tasks** (35 min) - Watch them try to complete goals
5. **Probing** (5 min) - Ask about specific observations
6. **Wrap-up** (5 min) - Open questions, thanks

**Think-aloud protocol:**
